GeoFood is a Android App that locates Restaurants in an area within a certain radius and price range 

Project Description
My Android app locates restaurants within a mile radius
and within a certain price range.The technologies I used 
for this project is android studio to develop the code xml 
resource files kotlin to write the logic of the app. It also 
uses the google places api that helped me get information about 
the restaurants and used to get photos of the restaurant. Some 
challenges that I faced implementing this app is using geolocation 
to get the current location of the user because I kept getting null 
pointer exceptions and trying to do an http request from an android app.
Another bug that I ran into is when you un save a restaurant it will add
another restaurant to the table layout so you just have to go home and 
go back to the saved restaurants.


How to Run the project 
You need to download the code into android studio and have a google api key
which is pretty easy to get. Once you have the code in android studio you will 
have to install it either on an android device or on the emulator.
This app was optimized for tablets so it might not look right on an android phone.

How to use the project 
When you launch the app you will be put into a screen with a map and sliders. 
To use the app you can either tap on the map the location you want to see restaurants 
of or you can press the top right drop down menu and press current location. 
Change the sliders on how you would like them to tap on the icon in the top menu 
next to the drop down menu then it will search for the restaurants depending 
on your sliders. To use this app make sure that you have an internet connection 
and have gps enabled if you want your current location.
